package main

// next is the deterministic regular-Pi progression planner (issue #195). It is
// READ ONLY: every invocation re-derives the day's next action from
// observations that already exist — the store's durable day, evidence and
// remote records, plus the artifact files the binary already owns — and prints
// ONE typed action. It writes nothing, carries no state between invocations and
// never executes anything.
//
// The predicate order below IS the pipeline. It is grounded in what the binary
// actually persists, which differs from the design sketch in two places:
//
//   - A finalized day is derived FIRST. The draft lives in $TMPDIR, so its
//     absence says nothing about a saved day; re-running the collect flow after
//     save would be refused by the verbs anyway.
//   - A recorded day is monotone: once entries exist, the draft/descriptions
//     judgment is over even if a fresh TMPDIR no longer holds the artifacts.
//     Re-judging a recorded day would re-run a paid judgment for no progress.
//
// Day.Staged and Day.SavedRevision are session-only fields (model.go), so the
// planner never reads them.
//
// Freshness is proven from CONTENT, not from published timestamps (which are
// second resolution and cannot distinguish a same-second ledger edit):
//
//   - staging is current when the stored stage map matches the ledger's own
//     stage-time projection (unit ids and per-unit span counts);
//   - classification is current when every persisted selection's
//     BlockContentDigest binds to the block that projection derives — the same
//     check save performs before it replays;
//   - a judgment answer is only consumed when it carries the digest this
//     report published (draft_digest for descriptions, ledger_digest for
//     classifications), so a stale answer file is never handed to a verb.
//
// Durables timestamps are used only where ordering genuinely is the fact: the
// plan tail's plan/observation/resolution relation.
