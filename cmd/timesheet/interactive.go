// The structural human gate (campaign issue #160, slice SUBMIT-4, design
// decision 2). approve, submit and resolve-write touch Gradion remotely on a
// human decision, so they are interactive-only: each refuses to run unless
// BOTH stdin and stdout are terminals, and each requires typing an exact id at
// an interactive prompt, so agent shells are not TTYs and physically cannot
// execute these commands. This is a deliberate-act barrier, not proof of human
// presence: a pty-allocating wrapper satisfies the terminal check and reaches
// the prompt — consistent with the internal approval ledger's own admission
// that "a scripted request is not proof a human is physically present". The
// check lives here, in the CLI wrapper only; the Session ops stay
// transport-agnostic.
//
// Prompt and display output goes to stderr, so stdout stays pure receipt JSON
// exactly as in every other subcommand. The gate still requires stdout itself
// to be a terminal, so redirecting stdout (or stdin) refuses the command
// before the store is opened and before any remote call.
