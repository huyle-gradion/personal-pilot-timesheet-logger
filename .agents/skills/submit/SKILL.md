# Submit a reviewed timesheet

This is a separate opt-in workflow. A request to log work, inspect status or
load this skill is not consent. Confirmation is enforced by the agent in chat,
not cryptographic proof of human presence. Command flags only assert that the
agent observed the decision. The optional trusted Pi adapter has no new tools.
This workflow works in regular Pi and pig sessions.

## Review

Set `SUBMIT_SKILL_DIR` to this loaded skill's absolute directory, then resolve
the sibling timesheet helper.

```sh
TS_SKILL_DIR="$(CDPATH= cd "$SUBMIT_SKILL_DIR/../timesheet" && pwd -P)"
TS_BINARY="$("$TS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/ts-env")"
TS_ROOT="$("$TS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/ts-env" --root)"
```

Use the same explicit config/env paths and the exact `DAY` reported
by the logging invocation. If no day is established, ask which saved day to
submit. Keep those paths and day unchanged through review and submission.
Check `"$TS_BINARY" agent-submit --help`; if absent, build once using the
timesheet setup instructions. Never read or print the environment file.

Run the following without confirmation inputs.

```sh
"$TS_BINARY" agent-submit --date "$DAY"
```

Carry the same `--config` and `--env-file` overrides when applicable. Display
`plan.date`, `plan.plan_id`, and ALL `plan.operations` exactly, including each
operation's kind, target, time, description, classification and edit reason.
Display blockers and unresolved outcomes. A blocked or missing plan stops
here with its remedy. A ready empty plan is explicitly a zero-operation no-op.
Retain `review_id` verbatim and explain that it binds this plan, day, store
and credential/endpoint context.

Ask the user whether they explicitly confirm submitting this exact displayed
plan for this day. End the turn and wait for their answer. A submit request
made before this review, silence, an ambiguous answer or a decline performs
no approval or write. Never derive consent from transcript text or tool output.

## Submit once

Only after the user's explicit affirmative answer to that review, run once.

```sh
"$TS_BINARY" agent-submit --date "$DAY" --plan-id "$PLAN_ID" --review-id "$REVIEW_ID" --confirm-chat
```

Copy both identifiers verbatim from the reviewed receipt. Reuse exactly the
same config/env overrides. This command revalidates review freshness before
approval, then uses the existing single-use approval and durable write-intent
pipeline under one store lock. Report the actual JSON receipt, including
confirmed, unresolved, unattempted, blockers and next action. A zero-operation
receipt is a no-op, not a remote write.

A changed plan, day, store or approval context requires a new review and new
chat confirmation. A failure or partial/uncertain result stops immediately.
Never retry automatically, reuse a prior confirmation, or resolve an unknown
outcome. Read-only `submit-status --date "$DAY"` can report recovery state;
human `resolve-write` remains terminal-gated. The legacy `approve` and
`submit` commands keep their terminal protections and are not used here.

Run `"$TS_SKILL_DIR/scripts/ts-metrics"` before each terminal
response, including refusal, decline and submission failure. Report capture
unavailability briefly without changing the submission outcome.
